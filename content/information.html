<h2>Annual Report</h2>
<h3>President's Report</h3>
<p>Cameron outlined the President's Report and reported that last year's snow season was a disappointing one, even though it showed some encouraging early signs.<br />
The lodge continued to perform well with members benefitting from all the renovations which were completed several seasons ago.<br />
Cameron thanked Barry McCann once again for being Winter Lodge manager last season and welcomed him again for this coming winter season.<br />
Maintenance works are an ongoing requirement and the committee is developing a staged plan which includes replacement of carpet in the bedrooms, main lounge and hallways and internal and external painting, both of which are major works.<br />
The subs have increased slightly this year to further help cover the costs/expenses of the lodge.<br />
We welcomed 3 new members to the club this year: Marcus Best, Edith Cinq and Victoria Cole. There have been 2 resignations, Julia Mayr and Arthur Mermigas.<br />
We now have 128 ordinary members and 1 life member. Some of our members have transferred their memberships, Marg Ruggles to Chris, Peter Batrouney to Charles and the Butlers to their sons, Edward and Chris.<br />
We trialled an extra Family week last year in July which worked well and so the committee have continued it this year. The committee will also look at an extra week for younger children in the June school holidays for next year as well.</p>
<p>Cameron thanked the committee for their on going support and commitment to the successful running of the lodge, particularly Bernie Mallia who was both the Booking Secretary and Treasurer, a huge job. He also thanked Peter for taking on the role as Booking Secretary for 2010. Thanks also went to Rob Hall for his huge amount of work as Lodge Manager, Elaine Robertson in her role as secretary, Robin Pennington, Ken Watkins, moved, Ben Wyatt seconded, that the resolution be passed. All were in favour. <b>Carried.</b></p>
<h2>General Business</h2>
<ul class="number">
  <li>Burnt Hut Spur has been burnt down due to lightning and it won't be in use this season. It is planned to instal a new detachable Quad next summer to the top of the Tyrol T bar.</li>
  <li>Updating of members details, please send emails to Elaine Robertson with correct addresses, particularly email addresses.</li>
  <li>Doug Bartley queried how we are going to fund a three year maintenance plan. The club has been able to reduce external debt and we are now looking at a staged maintenance plan. We are hoping to get the majority of the money through lodge fees.</li>
  <li>Chaz Batrouney offered to set up a web page for the club.</li>
  <li>Ken Watkins has a business that manufactures Apres Ski boots - please contact him on 9486 3880 if you're interested in purchasing these.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cameron thanked everyone for attending the AGM and noted that refreshments were being served after the meeting.</p>
