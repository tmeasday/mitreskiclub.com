  Also enclosed are the 2010/2011 Booking Rules and a sample booking form. Lodge fees remain the same as last season for
members and their families or first accompanied visitors. However, the Committee felt it was appropriate to increase the fees for second or subsequent visitors by $5 and for visitors organised by the Winter Manager by $10. Accordingly, the fees forsecond or subsequent visitors mid week will be $50, on weekends will be $70 and for Winter Manager visitor will be $85. It is hoped that these increases will not impact significantly on members and their families but will give the Club's finances a small boost as we look to reduce our debt over the next couple of years.

  Bookings by mail and email are now open. Telephone bookings are NOT open yet, except for off-season use.

  This year the Booking Secretary role will be carried out by Peter Lewinsky (subject to formal election at the AGM). All bookings should be directed to Peter. His address, phone number and email address are on the booking form. The Booking Secretary's role is extremely time consuming. Please try and minimise the burden by sticking to the Rules.
</p>
  As always, if a booking is not followed by prompt payment, the booking will be automatically lost. <b>It is your responsibility to ensure that your booking and your guests bookings are paid for on time.</b>
</p>
<p>
  At this stage, the easiest method is mailing a completed booking form to Peter together with a cheque for the lodge fees.
</p>
<p>
  The booking priority period for members is until (and including) Friday 7 May. If, at that date, any nights are over-booked, positions will be balloted. I encourage you to submit your bookings during the priority period to avoid disappointment.
</p>
<p>
  Telephone booking night will again be on Monday and Thursday between the hours of 7.30pm and 9.00pm. Please observe
these hours. You can send emails at any time (which the Committee encourages). The email will be checked at least on, every Monday and Thursday so you should assume that your email will not be received until the Monday or Thursday after
you send it. Bookings must be paid for in full by the booking night after that (for example, if you send an email to Peter on Sunday, he will receive it on Monday and your booking will be held until Thursday).
</p>
<p>
  If you want to book for more than 20 nights, please let Peter so that he can seek the prior approval of the Committee in accordance with Rule 13.
